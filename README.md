# MyReads React Project

The book tracking project is an application developed using the React library that allows users to categorize their books into three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to read and Read. With a simple and user-friendly interface, users can easily add new books to their library by searching and then selecting which shelf it belongs to. Users can also switch between shelves to update their reading progress. This project is ideal for book lovers who want to effectively manage and track their reading progress.

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.


To initiate this project:

install all project dependencies with `npm install`.

Then run, `npm start` to display the application.
